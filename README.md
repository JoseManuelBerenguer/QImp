# QImp (Max/MSP)

## ðŸŽ¯ Concept & Vision

QImp navigates an adimensional, abstract universeâ€”aware that the journey may never reach port. It is the allegory of the echo of an impenetrable braneâ€”a sonic artifact dwelling on the boundary between the known and the unreachable.

It expresses a realm beyond revelation: an aâ€‘human creation that transcends human senses and unfolds before us as an enigma. Eight quantum rotations, filtered through sonic and musical descriptors, are reshaped by an unexpected oracle that inserts itself into the code like a dark sigh. The resulting QASM circuit, processed by the microâ€‘Qiskit simulator, produces a 256â€‘dimensional complex state vector that is embodied in an antiâ€‘human space of FFT filters crafting sometimes frozen, sometimes burning soundscapes, while a reverberant piano evokes distant stars.

Thus, a poignant paradox emerges: QImpâ€”an aâ€‘human artifactâ€”presents itself to humans as fragments of reality that, every 49â€¯ms, cross the boundary between chaos and intention. We hear quantum entanglement manifested sonicallyâ€”interdependent, resonant sonic structures, echoes from a universe that defies our logic.

A tremor of antiâ€‘intuition and rhythmic irrationality, QImp does not intend to replicate human gestures. It breathes beyond us. It becomes an inverted mirror: we are not the ones who create itâ€”instead, it reveals our inability to understand what we feel, despite its manifest beauty. In this realm, music ceases to be a human gesture and becomes an aâ€‘human gestureâ€”a sonic presence that transcends our empathy, inviting us, without promise, to listen to something emerging from unfathomable dimensions.

Unfortunately, I cannot give it a physical form until I secure resources to present it as an installation: in a dimly lit room, a spotlight falls on a MIDI grand piano controlled by the system. Encircled by four speakers emitting frozen or burning soundscapes according to the spectra, the system continuously generates unrepeatable productions. Meanwhile, I envision presenting its potentially infinite generative nature in IP space. For now, only the code is available, downloadable and runnable on any sufficiently powerful computer.

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This repository contains a quantum-inspired generative system implemented in Max/MSP, combining:

- Quantum gate sequencing via JavaScript (`qasm_omax.js`)
- A minimal local simulator derived from microQiskit (`micro_qiskit_omax.js`)
- Patchers for spectral processing and control:
  - `0.QImp.maxpat`
   -`demantisa.js`
  - `fftfilter1.maxpat`
  - `fftfilter2.maxpat`
  - `pffttotal.maxpat`
  - `zsa.totalabstraction~.maxpat`
 - Audio descriptors via `zsa~`
- Spatial reverb with `hiss.convolver~` from the HISSTools IR Toolbox
- Interface logic in `demantisa.js`
