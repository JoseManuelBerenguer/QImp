# QASM OMAX (Max/MSP)

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This repository contains a quantum-inspired generative system implemented in Max/MSP, combining:

- Quantum gate sequencing via JavaScript (`qasm_omax.js`)
- A minimal local simulator derived from microQiskit (`micro_qiskit_omax.js`)
- Patchers for spectral processing and control:
  - `0.caparazon.maxpat`
  - `fftfilter1.maxpat`
  - `fftfilter2.maxpat`
  - `pffttotal.maxpat`
  - `zsa.totalabstraction~.maxpat`
- Audio descriptors via `zsa~`
- Spatial reverb with `hiss.convolver~` from the HISSTools IR Toolbox
- Interface logic in `demantisa.js`
